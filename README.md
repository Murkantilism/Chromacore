## Description

Positive audiovisual feedback rewards players for successul gameplay, while negative feedback is non-existent.

The prototype for this game was originally developed by Deniz Ozkaynak, Jen Tella, Korbin Shuffelton, and Jeff Fienberg at Northeastern University for the Game Assets & Prototyping class, taught by Joshua Gross.
