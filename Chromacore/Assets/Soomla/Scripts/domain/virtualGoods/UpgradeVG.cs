	/// <summary>
	/// An upgrade virtual good is one VG in a series of VGs that define an upgrade scale of an associated VirtualGood.
	///
	/// This type of virtual good is best explained with an example:
	/// Lets say you have a strength attribute to your character in the game and that strength is on the scale 1-5.
	/// You want to provide your users with the ability to upgrade that strength. This is what you'll need to create:
	///  1. SingleUseVG for 'strength'
	///  2. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 1'
	///  3. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 2'
	///  4. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 3'
	///  5. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 4'
	///  6. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 5'
	///
	/// Now, when the user buys this UpgradeVG, we check and make sure the appropriate conditions are met and buy it for you
	/// (which actually means we upgrading the associated VirtualGood).
	///
	/// This VirtualItem is purchasable.
	/// In case you purchase this item in the mobile market (PurchaseWithMarket), You need to define the item in the 
	/// Developer Console.
